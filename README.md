# Assessment_7_Resubmission
In my Assessment 7 plan file, you can see my thought process of how I approached the task at hand. I have a five-option menu that can be utilized to add holidays, delete holidays, view holidays, save changes, and exit. When adding, deleting, or viewing holidays, the user will be ultimately utilizing a list of dictionaries that contain the name, date, and week number of every holiday in a given year. In my Assessment 7 Jupyter Notebook file (please let me know if this file is difficult to read), we have all my code. For example, when scraping the https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/ website, I needed to perform multiple transformations to get the data into a "usable" form. In my code, I created a main menu function that uses 5 separate functions (addHoliday, viewHoliday, removeHoliday, exit, and save). This took up the main bulk of my code. I also used a weather api https://open-meteo.com/en/docs (documentation) to gather the weather data for this current week (10/7 to 10/12). This api section works correctly, but I wish I could have found a lengthier weather API with more dates stored. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
